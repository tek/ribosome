# Overview

_Ribosome_ is a suite of libraries for building [Neovim](https://neovim.io) remote plugins in Haskell, using the
algebraic effect system [Polysemy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/polysemy) as its foundation.

Its components are:

* [ribosome](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ribosome-host/docs/Ribosome.html) High-level functionality for writing
  plugins
* [ribosome-host](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ribosome-host/docs/Ribosome-Host.html) MessagePack RPC server and
  TH-generated API functions
* [ribosome-host-test](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ribosome-host/docs/Ribosome-Host-Test.html) Test utilities
  for `ribosome-host`
* [ribosome-test](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ribosome-host/docs/Ribosome-Test.html) Test utilities for
  `ribosome`
* [ribosome-menu](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ribosome-host/docs/Ribosome-Menu.html) A fuzzy-finder menu tool

# Quickstart

Install the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/learn.html) and generate a skeleton project by running:

```bash
$ nix run 'github:tek/ribosome#new'
```

The new project will contain configuration for Github Actions that release binary executables on each push that will be
downloaded automatically when a user starts the plugin for the first time, with support for pushing and downloading from
[Cachix](https://app.cachix.org/).

After initial generation, the Github Actions and Neovim boot files can be regenerated by running:

```bash
$ nix run '.#boot'
```
